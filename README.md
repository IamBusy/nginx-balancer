# nginx-balancer
This is a balancer based on [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)

## Why
I am taking charge of the development of a startup. There are so many services to manage and dispatch to, So I decide to build a gateway and balancer for them. 

I searched in the [hub.docker.com](http://hub.docker.com), but the repository [nginx-balancer](https://hub.docker.com/r/strm/nginx-balancer/) has been invalid, so I make it.
